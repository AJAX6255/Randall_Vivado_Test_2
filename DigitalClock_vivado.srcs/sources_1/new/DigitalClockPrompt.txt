For generating an ideal prompt that reflects the provided Vivado code for the DigitalClock module as closely as possible, consider this detailed guidance:

Ideal Prompt for Generating Similar Vivado Code:
"Create a Verilog module named DigitalClock for an FPGA-based clock system with the following characteristics:

Inputs:

Control signals: ONOFF (main power), CLOCKMODE (toggle between clock modes), RESET (general reset), PRESET (preset values).
Time control: LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN for adjusting time, stopwatch, alarm, and timer.
Stopwatch controls: STOPWATCH, PAUSESTOPWATCH, RESETSTOPWATCH for basic stopwatch functions.
Alarm controls: ALARM, ONOFFALARM to manage alarm settings and activation.
Timer controls: TIMER, SETTIMER, RESETTIMER, ONOFFTIMER for timer functionality.
Outputs:

Anode and segment outputs: Anode_Activate (4-bit) to activate the clock anodes and LED_out (7-bit) for displaying digits on a 7-segment display.
Miscellaneous: DP for the decimal point, beep to trigger an alarm sound, AMPM to indicate AM/PM for 12-hour mode.
Mode indicators: mode (2-bit) output to represent different operating modes (e.g., clock, stopwatch, alarm, timer).
Functionality:

Implement multiple clocks (1s, 0.3s, 0.01s) using clock division and counting registers. For instance, a 50 MHz input clock generates a 1s pulse (CLKOUT), a 0.3s pulse (CLKOUT300MS), and a 0.01s pulse (CLKOUT10MS).
Count and time adjustment: Manage seconds, minutes, and hours counters with configurable increments based on the UP and DOWN inputs.
Stopwatch and Timer: Enable basic stopwatch functionality with pause and reset options. For the timer, include countdown functionality, and trigger an output beep when the timer completes.
Alarm setting and control: Set the alarm time and enable a beep sound when the current time matches the alarm time.
Use modular state-based functionality in mode for various operational modes:
Mode 00 for clock, 01 for stopwatch, 10 for alarm, and 11 for timer.
Display Formatting: For each mode, format h1, h2, m1, m2, s1, s2 for segmented display output based on the current mode and values.
Submodule Integration:

Include a submodule sseg for controlling 4-digit 7-segment display refreshing with digit multiplexing.
sseg inputs: CLK, ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, xpos (display position).
sseg outputs: anode activation, 7-segment values, and decimal point control.
Additional Details:

Set initial states for outputs and counters as required by reset conditions.
Include modular always blocks with conditions based on posedge CLK, RESET, and each secondary clock (1s, 0.3s, 0.01s).
Use consistent register naming and modular always blocks to manage counter increments and display updates based on time.
Note: Ensure correct timing constraints for stable operation on an FPGA, especially regarding the multiple internal clocks and multiplexed displays."

This prompt offers a comprehensive outline to capture the DigitalClockâ€™s key requirements and internal clock structures, along with clear design expectations to reproduce similar functionality and structure.
